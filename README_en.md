# Automation_Script

## Introduction

This repository is a collection of various automation scripts that I frequently use in my work, mainly for server management and system administration scenarios. As IT infrastructure becomes increasingly complex, utilizing automation tools can not only significantly improve work efficiency but also reduce potential human errors and ensure consistency in system operations. Whether you are a system administrator managing hundreds of servers or a technician handling daily maintenance, the tools in this repository can assist you greatly! ðŸ’¡

## Background

In modern enterprises, whether it's large-scale data centers or distributed server management, automation scripts are essential technical tools. Manual operations can be prone to errors, especially when performing batch operations, where any small mistake can lead to system instability or downtime. Therefore, these scripts are designed to help technicians simplify common tasks, including remote server management, monitoring, and daily system maintenance.

This repository covers IPMI OOB and in-band operation scripts, Python and Shell scripts, which can solve many challenges in daily work and provide flexibility and scalability in the automation process.

## Contents

### IPMI OOB Automation Scripts

IPMI OOB (Out-Of-Band) automation scripts are specifically designed for remote server management, allowing server control even when the operating system is down or inaccessible. These scripts enable operations such as server reboot, hardware health check, and diagnostics, making them ideal for maintenance work in emergency situations.

**Key Features:**
- Remote server power management
- Server reboot and shutdown commands
- Hardware monitoring (temperature, fan, voltage, etc.)

### IPMI In-Band Automation Scripts

These scripts operate through the serverâ€™s internal network interface, suitable for management and maintenance operations when the server system is running well. Compared to OOB operations, in-band management can perform more detailed operations such as checking server logs, updating BIOS, and managing server configurations.

**Key Features:**
- Daily health checks
- System BIOS or firmware updates
- System performance monitoring and reporting

### Python Scripts

Python, as a powerful automation and system integration tool, offers flexibility and scalability. These scripts can help us quickly accomplish tasks such as API calls, automated report generation, and data processing. Python scripts are simple in design and easy to modify, allowing quick expansion based on needs and seamless integration with other tools.

**Key Features:**
- Automated API calls
- Report generation
- Data analysis tools

### Shell Scripts

Shell scripts are indispensable tools in system administration, especially for various automation operations in Linux or UNIX environments. These scripts can help technicians perform common tasks such as file backup and recovery, system monitoring, and log analysis. Shell scripts are intuitive and powerful, enabling the chaining of multiple system commands for automated operations.

**Key Features:**
- File backup and restoration
- System log analysis
- Automated maintenance tasks

## Use Cases

These automation scripts are suitable for many scenarios, whether itâ€™s server management in large data centers or repetitive tasks in daily maintenance. These tools can save you valuable time and effort.

- Server Management: Remote reboot, power management, hardware monitoring, etc.
- Maintenance Monitoring: System performance checks and log analysis to effectively grasp the health status of servers.
- Automated Data Processing: Using Python scripts for large-scale data processing and report generation.
