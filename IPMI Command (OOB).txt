reboot BMC：
ipmitool -H (Host, BMC management IP address) -l lanplus -U (BMC login user name) -P (BMC login user name password) mc reset <warm/cold>

9.setting BMC iptables firewall

setting some of section IP can save BMC
ipmitool -H (Host, BMC management IP address) -l lanplus -U (BMC login user name) -P (BMC login user name password) raw 0x32 0x76 0x01 0x01 ip1(0xa 0xa 0xa 0xa) ip2(0xb 0xb 0xb 0xaxb)

ipmitool -H (Host, BMC management IP address) -l lanplus -U (BMC login user name) -P (BMC login user name password) raw 0x32 0x76 0x09

setting IP can save BMC
ipmitool -H (Host, BMC management IP address) -l lanplus -U (BMC login user name) -P (BMC login user name password) raw 0x32 0x76 0x00 0x01 ip1(0xa 0xa 0xa 0xa)

ipmitool -H (Host, BMC management IP address) -l lanplus -U (BMC login user name) -P (BMC login user name password) raw 0x32 0x76 0x09
